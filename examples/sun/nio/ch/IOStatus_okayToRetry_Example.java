     * A simple example that demonstrates the use of IOStatus, which is a part of NIO in Java.
     * <p>
     * This code shows how to handle situations where an I/O operation could potentially be interrupted or have an ongoing task associated with it.
     * <p>
     * The IOStatus class provides utility methods for handling such situations. In this example, we demonstrate the use of the okayToRetry(IOException)) method provided by the IOStatus class.
