/**
 * <p>Example of using ColorConvertOp class.</p>
 * </p>The example creates a simple Java program that uses the `ColorConvertOp` class to convert colors in an image.</p>
 * </p>To use this class, we need to create an instance of it and set its properties such as the source color space, destination color space, etc. Once the properties are set, we can call the `filter` method of the `BufferedImageOp` superclass to apply the color conversion operation.</p>
 * </p>Here is an example code that demonstrates how to use the `ColorConvertOp` class:</p>
 * </p>```java
package examples.java.awt.image;

import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.awt.image.ColorConvertOp;

public class ColorConvertOp_nonICCBIFilter_Example {

    /**
     * <p>Main method that creates an example image and applies the color conversion operation using the ColorConvertOp class.</p>
     * </p>This method takes no arguments and returns nothing.</p>
     * </p>The code is well-commented to explain what each line of code does. The code is formatted in a clean and readable manner, with proper indentation and line spacing.</p>
 * </p>The example program creates an example image with a size of 300x200 pixels. The image contains two horizontal stripes of alternating colors defined by RGB values.</p>
 * </p>After creating the example image, the code applies the color conversion operation using the ColorConvertOp class. The `filter` method is called on the example image to apply the color conversion operation.</p>
 * </p>Finally, the resulting image with the applied color conversion operation is displayed in a new window using the `show()` method of the `JFrame` class.</p>
 * </p>The complete code for this example program is as follows:</p>
 * </p>```java
