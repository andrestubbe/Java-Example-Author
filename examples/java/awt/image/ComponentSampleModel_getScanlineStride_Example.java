    /**
     * This example demonstrates how to use the `ComponentSampleModel` class in Java's `java.awt.image` package to calculate the scanline stride of an image.
     *
     * The `ComponentSampleModel` class is a concrete implementation of the `ImageSampleModel` abstract class, which itself is a part of the broader `java.awt.image` package.
     *
     * The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to use the `getScanlineStride()` method of the `ComponentSampleModel` class to calculate the scanline stride (in terms of the number of pixels) of an image that uses a `ComponentSampleModel` instance as its sample model.
     *
     * The `getScanlineStride()` method is defined in the `ImageConsumer` abstract class, which itself is another part of the broader `java.awt.image` package.
     *
     * This example provides an implementation of the `ImageConsumer` interface that uses the `ComponentSampleModel` class as its sample model. The implementation calculates the scanline stride (in terms of the number of pixels)) of the image using the `getScanlineStride()` method of the `ComponentSampleModel` class.
