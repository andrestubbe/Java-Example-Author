 * BandCombineOp_getRenderingHints_Example is a Java class that demonstrates the usage of the `BandCombineOp` class within a single Java file. This code provides an example of how to use the `BandCombineOp` class and its methods in order to achieve a specific outcome.
 * 
 * The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to create a custom `BufferedImageOp` implementation using the `BandCombineOp` class as the base class for the custom implementation. This custom implementation will allow users to perform custom image processing operations that are specific to their particular use case.
