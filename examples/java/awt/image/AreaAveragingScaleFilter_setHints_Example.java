/**
 * The `AreaAveragingScaleFilter` class represents an area averaging scale filter that can be used to downscale an image while maintaining the average brightness of the original pixels within the scaled region.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses OpenCV, which provides a convenient Java API for working with images and video.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use this class, you will need to add the OpenCV library to your project's dependencies.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of how to use the `AreaAveragingScaleFilter` class:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * First, you will need to create an instance of the `AreaAveragingScaleFilter` class, passing in the original image as a parameter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Next, you can call the `setHints` method on the `AreaAveragingScaleFilter` object, passing in any desired hints for scaling the image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Finally, you can call the `filter` method on the `AreaAveragingScaleFilter` object, passing in a `BufferedImage` object representing the scaled image. The `filter` method will modify the original image to reflect the scaled version.
