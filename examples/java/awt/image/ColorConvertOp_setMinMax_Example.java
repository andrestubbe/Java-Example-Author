/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use the {@link ColorConvertOp} class to convert the color space of an image. This is useful when working with images that have different color spaces than the device being used to view them.
 * 
 * The `ColorConvertOp` class provides a way to perform color space conversions on images. To use this class, you first need to create an instance of it by calling its constructor and passing in any necessary parameters (e.g. the desired output color space)).
 * 
 * Once you have created an instance of `ColorConvertOp`, you can then call its various methods to perform different operations on the image data that is stored within the `Image` object.
 * 
 * In this example, we will be demonstrating how to use the `ColorConvertOp` class to convert the color space of an image. We will be performing this operation using the `setMinMax()` method as an example of how to use other methods provided by the `ColorConvertOp` class.
