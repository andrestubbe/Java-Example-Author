/**
 * Example program that demonstrates how to use the
 * {@link ComponentSampleModel} class in Java's AWT package. This example specifically focuses on demonstrating how to create an instance of this class and then call its `hashCode()` method, which is a built-in method in Java for generating a hash code based on the state of the object it belongs to.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this example program is to provide a clear and concise demonstration of how to use the {@link ComponentSampleModel} class in Java's AWT package, specifically focusing on demonstrating how to create an instance of this class and then call its `hashCode()` method. This is done by creating an instance of the {@link ComponentSampleModel} class, setting its properties and then calling its `hashCode()` method.
 * <p>
 * The result of running this program will be a series of System.out.println() statements that display the hash code values for various instances of the {@link ComponentSampleModel} class. This demonstrates how to use the {@link ComponentSampleModel} class in Java's AWT package, specifically focusing on demonstrating how to create an instance of this class and then call its `hashCode()` method.

     * Example main method that demonstrates how to use the {@link ComponentSampleModel} class in Java's AWT package. This example specifically focuses on demonstrating how to create an instance of this class and then call its `hashCode()` method.
     * <p>
     * This main method creates various instances of the {@link ComponentSampleModel} class, sets their properties and then calls their `hashCode()` method to generate hash codes for these instances. The resulting hash code values are then printed to the console using System.out.println() statements.

     * <p>
     * Note that the hash code values generated by calling the `hashCode()` method on instances of the {@link ComponentSampleModel} class may vary depending on the specific properties set for each instance, as well as any other factors that might impact the generation of hash codes based on the state of the object it belongs to.
     * <p>
     * It is always a good practice to rely solely on the JVM's built-in hash code generation mechanism when generating hash codes for objects in Java. This ensures maximum portability and maintainability of your code, as well as better performance optimization opportunities within the JVM itself.
