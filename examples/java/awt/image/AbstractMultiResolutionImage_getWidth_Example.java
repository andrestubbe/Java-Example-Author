 * <p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to correctly instantiate and use methods from the AbstractMultiResolutionImage superclass.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This example specifically showcases the following key concepts:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Instantiation of an instance of the AbstractMultiResolutionImage superclass.</li>
 *   <li>Usage of various methods provided by the AbstractMultiResolutionImage superclass.</li>

     * <p>This method is a simple example of how to use the getWidth() method from the AbstractMultiResolutionImage superclass.</p>
     * 
     * <p>In this example, we create an instance of the AbstractMultiResolutionImage superclass and then call the getWidth() method on it.</p>
     * 
     * <p>The result of calling the getWidth() method is a single integer value representing the width of the image in pixels. This value can be used for various purposes such as displaying the image's dimensions or performing further operations on the image data.</p>
     * 
     * <p>In summary, this example demonstrates how to create and use an instance of the AbstractMultiResolutionImage superclass and then call the getWidth() method on it in order to retrieve the width of the image in pixels.</p>
