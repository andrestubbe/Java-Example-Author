/**
 * This example demonstrates how to get the transparency of a BufferedImage. The transparency is represented as an integer between 0 and 255, where 0 represents completely transparent pixels and 255 represents completely opaque pixels. By default, the alpha-channel (transparency) of a BufferedImage is not enabled, which means that all the pixels of the BufferedImage are considered fully opaque. However, you can enable the alpha-channel and specify the transparency values for each pixel of the BufferedImage by calling the `setTransparency` method provided below:
 *
 * @param image The BufferedImage for which to get the transparency.
 * @return The transparency value for the given BufferedImage.
