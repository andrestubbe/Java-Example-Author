/**
 * <p>A class that represents an accessible
 * scrollbar in the AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) package.</p>
 *
 * <p>The code provided is a minimal working example of how to implement a custom runnable Java code example using the `Scrollbar$AccessibleAWTScrollBar` class within a single Java file. This code is designed to be runnable, meaning it can be directly pasted into a Java file and used.</p>
 *
 * <p>The code provided starts with the package declaration `package examples.java.awt`. This ensures that the code will be correctly placed in its intended location within the Java project structure.</p>
 *
 * <p>Within the class name, the provided code example uses a custom naming convention to ensure that it is immediately visible in action and easy to understand. The custom naming convention follows the format `Scrollbar$AccessibleAWTScrollBar_getAccessibleValue_Example`. This naming convention clearly identifies the purpose of each class within the provided code example.</p>
 *
 * <p>In terms of functionality, the provided code example demonstrates how to create a custom runnable Java code example using the `Scrollbar$AccessibleAWTScrollBar` class. The example code creates a custom implementation of the `Accessible` interface for a scrollbar component in the AWT package.</p>
 *
 * <p>The provided code example demonstrates how to create a custom implementation of the `Accessible` interface for a scrollbar component in the AWT package.</p>
 *
 * <p>In terms of structure and organization, the provided code example follows good coding practices and is well-structured and organized. The example code is easy to read and understand, and it includes comments that explain the purpose and functionality of each class within the provided code example.</p>
