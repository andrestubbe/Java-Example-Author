This Java code block creates a class named `RoundRectangle2D$Double_getBounds2D_Example` which demonstrates how to use the `RoundRectangle2D$Double` class in Java. 

The class is designed to get the bounds of a specific instance of `RoundRectangle2D$Double`. This example specifically shows how to retrieve the bounds of a specific instance of `RoundRectangle2D$Double`.

To test this functionality, you can create an instance of `RoundRectangle2D$Double` and pass it as an argument to the `getBounds()` method. The `getBounds()` method will then return a new `Area` object that contains the bounds of the given `RoundRectangle2D$Double` object.

To retrieve the bounds of the given `RoundRectangle2D$Double` object, you can simply call the `getBounds2D()` method on the specific instance of `RoundRectangle2D$Double`. This will return a new `Rectangle2D` object that contains the bounds of the given `RoundRectangle2D$Double` object.

To make this functionality visible in action, you can call the `getBounds()` method on an instance of `RoundRectangle2D$Double` and pass it as an argument to the `getBounds()` method. The `getBounds()` method will then return a new `Area` object that contains the bounds of the given `RoundRectangle2D$Double` object.

To check the result, you can call the `getBounds2D()` method on the specific instance of `RoundRectangle2D$Double` and print out its bounds in a readable format. For example:
```java
Rectangle2D bounds = roundRectangle2D.getBounds2D();
System.out.println("X: " + bounds.getX() + ", Y: " + bounds.getY() + ", Width: " + bounds.getWidth() + ", Height: " + bounds.getHeight());
