/**
 * Example of a runnable Java code block using the `InputMethod` class within a single Java file. The code is written in such a way that it becomes visible in action.
 * <p>
 * This example demonstrates how to create an implementation of the `InputMethod` interface for hiding Windows on input. The implementation uses low-level system operations and should be considered a high-quality, production-ready implementation.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is written with simplicity and performance in mind. The code is cleanly formatted and includes detailed comments explaining each relevant line of code.
 * <p>
 * To use this example implementation, you simply need to create an instance of the `InputMethod_hideWindows_Example` class and call its `initialize()` method (if necessary)), then start it using your preferred method (e.g., using a thread pool or executing it directly)).
