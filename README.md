# Java-Examples

This project automatically creates beginner-friendly Java example programs — for **every single Java command**. 

## What is it?

I built a system that scans the entire Java language and collects **170,000+ commands** (like a dictionary). Then, using `ollama run stable-code`, it asks an AI to generate one **simple example per command**. 

Yes — 170,000 code snippets.  
No manual work. Pure automation.

## Why?

- Oracle provides documentation, but not per-command examples.
- This is for **learners**, not experts.
- You see a command — you see how it works. That simple.

## How?

- Language: **Java**
- AI: [`stable-code`](https://ollama.com/library/stable-code) via [`ollama`](https://ollama.com)
- Process: A Java class runs the AI prompt loop.
- Time: One full pass = **343.5 days** nonstop. 🫠  
  (I may need more machines...)

## Goal

A **huge open-source book** with every Java command + example.  
Something that actually helps beginners.  
Published weekly on GitHub. Free.  

## Motivation

> *“Aus dem gelernten AI-Chatbot-Wissen muss ja etwas werden.”*  
I wanted to build something real with AI — and now I can.  
Maybe one day, someone Googles a Java command, lands here, and learns something... with my name on it.

## Status

⏳ Generating... publishing updates weekly.

Want it tighter, more German, or more dev-focused?
